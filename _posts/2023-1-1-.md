# UHH new year !?
to be honest .... im lazy as hell never wanted to do something nor wanna explore something new ... i did spend my last year doing nothin' just watched anime and wasted my time successfully ..

# I wanna change my self ?
i spent my 2 years doing nothin' but now ... i just dont wanna continue like this... changes are hard and i know i can loose my path again but ... i just dont wanna be a looser anymore.

# I had may toxic friends in past!
those who just came to me for their selfish intentions i was stupid runnig to talk with them and wasting my time ... i grew sick of it ,,,, tried to find happiness via doing nothing ... and wasting my life for nothing 

# IM gonna change my life !!!
there is no room for those fake people .... i dont need friends to pass the time I have a aim now ... I'll focus on that

# falling in love ?
the truth is i never fell in love .... i pretended to be in love but the truth is i dont feel anything for the person i supposed to love.... i just did it to get in the group of normies but in reality those people meant nothing to me
so i just dont wanna continue lying to myself I'll make my feelings clear this year.... I dont feel anything for those who were not there when i needed them ... only my brothers, my family only they were there for me so why i need unnecessary crowd... ? 

# I'll change myself this year for sure ? no room for unnecessary people ... I'll do everything for those who love me for real even if they are very few .. you just need one person who really believes in you
